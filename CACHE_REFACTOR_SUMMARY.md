# Cache Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Refactored the artist cache system to include artist names alongside genres and country information. This change makes it easier to manipulate the cache directly and reduces the need for Spotify API calls in other files.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Cache Structure
The cache now stores three pieces of information for each artist:
- `name`: Artist name (new field)
- `genres`: List of genres (existing)
- `country`: Country information (existing)

### 2. Modified Files

#### Artist_Cacher.py
- Updated to store artist names in the cache when caching artist data
- Modified both batch processing and fallback individual requests to include artist names

#### Update_Cache.py
- Updated to include artist names when updating the cache
- Modified both batch processing and fallback individual requests to include artist names

#### Genre_Tools.py
- Enhanced `load_artist_cache()` function to handle migration from old cache formats
- Added `get_artist_name_from_cache()` helper function for retrieving artist names
- Updated `get_artist_genres()` and `get_artist_genres_batch()` to include artist names in cache entries

#### Manual_Country_Inputs.py
- Removed dependency on Spotify API for getting artist names
- Now uses `get_artist_name_from_cache()` function
- Eliminates unnecessary API calls when artist names are already cached

#### Manual_Genre_Inputs.py
- Removed dependency on Spotify API for getting artist names
- Now uses `get_artist_name_from_cache()` function
- Eliminates unnecessary API calls when artist names are already cached

#### List_Empty_Cache.py
- Optimized to use cached artist names when available
- Only makes Spotify API calls for artists not in cache
- Reduces API usage while maintaining functionality

### 3. Migration Support
The `load_artist_cache()` function now handles migration from old cache formats:
- Old list format: `{"artist_id": ["genre1", "genre2"]}`
- Old dict format without name: `{"artist_id": {"genres": [...], "country": "..."}}`
- New format with name: `{"artist_id": {"name": "...", "genres": [...], "country": "..."}}`

### 4. New Helper Function
Added `get_artist_name_from_cache()` function that:
- First tries to get the artist name from cache
- Falls back to Spotify API if not cached or name is None
- Updates the cache with the name if it wasn't there
- Returns a fallback string if API call fails

## Benefits

1. **Reduced API Calls**: Manual input files no longer need to make Spotify API calls for artist names
2. **Better Cache Manipulation**: Having artist names in cache makes it easier to work with the data directly
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing cache files are automatically migrated to the new format
4. **Improved Performance**: Faster access to artist information without API delays
5. **Better User Experience**: Manual input tools work faster and more reliably

## Testing
Created `test_cache_refactor.py` to verify:
- Cache structure includes artist names
- Migration from old formats works correctly
- Helper functions work as expected

## Usage
The refactoring is transparent to existing code. Files that previously made Spotify API calls for artist names now use the cache automatically, with fallback to API calls when necessary.

To populate the cache with artist names, run:
```bash
python Artist_Cacher.py
```

To update existing cache entries with names, run:
```bash
python Update_Cache.py
```
